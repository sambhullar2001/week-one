# what I was trying to do

- trying to find material related to my interests in moturary archaeology. More specifically information on the evolution of familial plots and graves.
- creating and downloading all the neccessary software and accounts needed for the course
- research graveyards and cemeteries to visit (so far, I have my eyes set on either Beechwod cemetery or Notre Dame cemetry... both are easilly accesible and have large quanities of graves from which i can choose from!)

## challenges 
- trouble finding appropriate sources for certain curiosities. Perhaps widening my search, and checking other Classics/Archaeological databases next week
- familiarsing myself with the software and programs that will be utilised over the course of the semester
- 
## thoughts on where to go next
- ask Kavita or Graham for directions if necessary
- however, the semester is still early so - luckily - so far there is not  many things that have gone awol :) ... yet :(
