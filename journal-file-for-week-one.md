# Introduction 
"The lines of privilege and power are far more insidious in our technology-drenched worlds than those who benefit from it care to recognize, let alone address, and there is a very troubling pattern intensifying before our eyes." (Cook, K. (2019). EmboDIYing Disruption: Queer, Feminist and Inclusive Digital Archaeologies. _European Journal of Archaeology_, _22_(3), 398–414.)
- the sentence up above is super itnersting, and was one of the first ones to truly catch my eye. It forces you stop, think, and ponder over the truly evil things that the can occur over the internet. It forces the reader to re-evaluate the pillars of the web that we praise; freedom, free speech, lack of censorship. And how those very pillars can be used against us in harmful and discriminatory ways.

***However! Getting back to CLCV 3000...

**Alrighty**! So we've just begun the course, and if I'm being completely honest, I had never heard about digital archaeology, bar a few passing remarks in CLCV 1008/9 during my 1st year of undergraduate studies at Carleton.  Prior to this course I had thought digital archaeology was simply archaeology which utilised a major digital/web component... from what it looks like, digital archaeology is much more multi-faceted than that. 

in terms of the course content itself, I can see a few things that already interest me in mortuary archaeology.

**Family Graves/Plots**
- Super interesting to delve into how familial relationships are memoralized in the modern era, and to see if *what* had forced such an occurance to be brought into the mainstream; poverty, tradition, etc.

**Religious Icongraphy**
- The presence of religious icongraphy - or lack thereof - in certain graves, and whether it trasnaltes to a simply dying fad (could if be correlated to dying popularity of religion within the modern era?), or not.

**Utlising Technology to capture remains and artifacts**
- this is quite possibly the most exciting aspect of the coming semester for me, as it involves venturing into territory I have not yet even ***heard of***!******
- It will be quite interesting to see how 

## Interesting Quotes from the Readings
"*Perhaps  one  of  the  most  notable  con- tributions  of  digital  technology  has been  the  dissolution  of  boundaries  to accessing  archaeological  data,  results, researchers  and  knowledge.  While  it has  long  been  challenging  to  identify “Canadian archaeology” in general*..." (Cool, Katherine. Compton, Mary E. (2018)*Canadian Digital Archaeology: On Boundaries and Futures. Canadian Journal of Archaeology.*)
- I had annotated this within hypothesis as well, however I'd like to reiterate how i find it fascinating that it is truly difficult to categorize "Canadian archaeology". What set parameters does such a term follow? Canada is still so young as a nation, does that follow over through to the archeological artifacts excavated? Would 'Indigenous archeoloagy' be a better term? All in all, good things to ponder over.

"... is only just beginning to hint at the widespread challenges and emotional toll that targeted members of the archaeological community continue to face. It is true that structures of discrimination, intimidation, and harassment have an unconscionably long history in archaeology..." (Cook, K. (2019). EmboDIYing Disruption: Queer, Feminist and Inclusive Digital Archaeologies. _European Journal of Archaeology_, _22_(3), 398–414.)
 - as a brown (almost) woman this resonates quite heavilly with me. Because such strcutures are not only in place in archaelogy (and other field of academia for that matter), however, are in place in NEARLY EVERY institute in much of the Western world. Such structures are the foundations of modern-day nations like the USA and Canada. I believe by acknowledging them, we venture into the first step of rectifying and undoing them.

**Annotations**
As for my annotations, the content this week was engaging... albeit a bit long at times. My Hypothesis username is linked below.
